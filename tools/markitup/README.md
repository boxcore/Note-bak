markItUp! 2 draft
=================

Due to popular demand, here is the draft code of markItUp! 2 started 3 years ago.
Unfortunately I have no time to work on it and finish it, so, instead of letting the project die, here it is.

This version is slow, buggy, non cross-browser and absolutely not proper for production or anything else.

Please, do not contact me to tell me there are thousands of bugs. I know it ;)
